# gulp-10-linting

This project demonstrates how to integrate linting into your build process using Gulp and ESLint, helping you enforce code quality and maintain consistent style throughout your JavaScript code.

---

## Overview

In this setup, we use [gulp-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-eslint) (or a similar plugin) to automatically analyze JavaScript files, identify potential errors, and ensure adherence to your preferred coding standards. This makes it easier to maintain clean, consistent, and error-free code.

## Features

- **Automated Linting:** Run linting checks on all JavaScript files.
- **Code Quality Enforcement:** Ensure adherence to defined coding conventions.
- **Customizable Rules:** Easily modify linting rules via ESLint configuration.
- **Task Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with other Gulp tasks in your build process.
