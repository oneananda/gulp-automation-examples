# gulp-10-linting

This project demonstrates how to integrate linting into your build process using Gulp and ESLint, helping you enforce code quality and maintain consistent style throughout your JavaScript code.

---

## Overview

In this setup, we use [gulp-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-eslint) (or a similar plugin) to automatically analyze JavaScript files, identify potential errors, and ensure adherence to your preferred coding standards. This makes it easier to maintain clean, consistent, and error-free code.

---

## Features

- **Automated Linting:** Run linting checks on all JavaScript files.
- **Code Quality Enforcement:** Ensure adherence to defined coding conventions.
- **Customizable Rules:** Easily modify linting rules via ESLint configuration.
- **Task Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with other Gulp tasks in your build process.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v10 or later recommended)
- [Gulp CLI](https://gulpjs.com/) (install via `npm install -g gulp-cli` if not already installed)
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js package management

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gulp-09-linting
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs all necessary packages, including Gulp and gulp-eslint.

## Project Structure

A typical project directory might look like this:

```
.
├── gulpfile.js     # Gulp configuration file containing linting tasks
├── package.json    # Project metadata and dependency definitions
├── .eslintrc.json  # ESLint configuration file with linting rules
└── src/
    └── js/
        └── *.js    # Your JavaScript source files for linting
```

---

## Usage

### Running the Linting Task

To execute the linting process, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
gulp lint
```

This command will:

- Locate all JavaScript files in the `src/js/` directory.
- Run ESLint on these files.
- Display any errors or warnings in the console.
- Fail the task if there are any linting errors, ensuring that code quality issues are addressed promptly.

### Example Gulp Task

Below is an example of a Gulp task for linting, defined in `gulpfile.js`:

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const eslint = require('gulp-eslint');

// Lint task: Scans JavaScript files for errors and style issues.
function lint() {
  return gulp.src('src/js/**/*.js')
    .pipe(eslint())          // Run ESLint.
    .pipe(eslint.format())   // Format the results and output to the console.
    .pipe(eslint.failAfterError());  // Fail the task if an error is found.
}

// Expose the lint task to be run with `gulp lint`
exports.lint = lint;
exports.default = lint;
```

This configuration:
- Targets all JavaScript files under the `src/js/` directory.
- Formats and prints linting results.
- Fails the task if any errors are found, ensuring issues must be resolved before proceeding.

## Customizing ESLint

You can customize the linting rules by modifying the `.eslintrc.json` file. Here’s an example configuration:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "es6": true
  },
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "rules": {
    "semi": ["error", "always"],
    "quotes": ["error", "single"]
  },
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "sourceType": "module"
  }
}
```

This setup:
- Defines the environment (browser, Node.js, ES6).
- Extends the recommended ESLint rules.
- Customizes rules to enforce semi-colon usage and single quotes.
- Sets parser options for modern JavaScript.

Feel free to adjust these settings to better match your project's specific needs.
